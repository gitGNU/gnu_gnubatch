To-Do List for GNUBATCH 1.5
===========================

This is the product distributed as Xi-Batch Release 6

PLEASE NOTE
===========

=====================================================================
| Much of what follows I have already implemented in a "ground-up"
| rewrite of the product (Release 7)  written between 2001 and 2008
| and almost complete. Hopefully this version will become GNUBATCH2.
|
| Before you do any extensive hacking on this please consider helping me
| get the new version off the ground and making sure I don't make
| too many errors therein!!

I don't care).

General Comments and History
----------------------------

I include the history as it explains why much is the way it
is. Possibly my incompetence or laziness is another reason.

I wrote the first version of this back in 1990 struggling on a
68000-based system with a few MB of memory, no VM without proper
debugging (remember ADB?) and everything. Much of the original code
was copied from Xi-Text (now GNUspool).

Then in 1993 I added networking. The trouble was that System V-based
systems didn't really understand networking and it was a layer on the
horrible not-invented-here socket replacement called Transport Layer
Interface and the ghastly "streams". A lot of people were running SCO
(that's the old SCO not the current outfit that sues everyone for
making better stuff than they do) which had weird security rules.

Then in 1994 I added X-Motif. I also wrote the Windows Client stuff
and developed the API.

I got bogged down for the next few years as someone was suing me
claiming they had rights to what I had written. It took over 10 years
to see that case off and not before the taxman lept in claiming I was
claiming the lawyers fees incorrectly as a business expense. A guided
tour of half the courts in England followed.

In the intervening years I added the web browser interface stuff. It
was my first venture into such things and it probably shows. Actually
it does show. It all wants rewriting in PHP.

So here we are today with the product as it stands. Yes it's showing
its history in lots of ways. But the core product is (I think) pretty
stable and solid.

TO-DO Part 1 - Overall look and feel
====================================

1. Networking
-------------

I think that it's fine when you have half a dozen machines in one
building and it nicely shares stuff between them. But if you
network in a remote machine, then that machine gets all the messages
about jobs being added and deleted, jobs starting and stopping etc
which are of no interest or concern to it.

I think we want to be able to configure the networking so there are
much looser levels of coupling available whilst still maintaining
something of the the current look and feel.

2. Users
--------

At the moment user access is tied to Unix user ids as found in the
password file.

A frequent request is that there shouldn't have to be a user name and
user id as given in the password file to decide user access as in many
cases jobs are generated from some server process receiving data
from elsewhere which knows nothing about the users on the machine
running this server process.

We need to have a mechanism to map external user names onto Unix ones
but preserve the original user names for mailing of reports.

Actually what we should do is have just "default" and a list of
exceptions rather than storing mostly identical permissions for nearly
everyone. Maybe this should be held as XML and read into shared memory
when anything starts up.

I've done most of this.

**** Most of this has been implemented in Xi-Batch R7

3. Charging
-----------

No one ever uses that so we'll get rid of it. We'll just have optional
log files showing what got run where at the instigation of whom.

I've done this.

4. Job Hierarchy
----------------

Rather than a single flat job queue I want to implement a heirarchy of
jobs and "super-jobs" or "queues" holding inferior jobs. At each level
there is a separate namespace of variables.

This has been implemented in Xi-Batch R7

5. Conditions and Assignments
-----------------------------

I want to remove the limit on the number of conditions and
assignments. I also want to be able to combine time and variable
conditions and link in a nested structure with AND OR and NOT.

I also think conditions and assignments should be part of a new kind
of object separate from jobs and variables which can be referred to
with parts overridden.

Conditions and assignments should have arbitrary expressions in and
should be able to access bits of jobs like the last run time.

**** This has been implemented in Xi-Batch R7.


TO-DO Part 2 - Internals
========================

1. Get rid of the message queue
-------------------------------

Message queues are evil because:

1. They are quite slow. This is because messages are sorted into an
   order given by the message type field to implement the full
   semantics. Unix kernels sort them on sending and Linux ones on
   receiving and both take far too long doing it (unnecessarily most
   of the time).

2. Some other application using message queues can clog up all the
   available buffer space for message queues system-wide causing us to
   fall over. This happens sufficiently often to be
   embarrassing. Recent Linux kernels have a way round this but I
   haven't tried it yet.

3. Security is poor - you just need the message queue id to start
   accessing it, you don't have file system permission semantics (not
   that they're perfect) stopping someone stomping on it.

4. You don't have any means of telling someone that a message has
   arrived so you end up with the signal mechanism currently in use to
   wake up a process with all the problems that causes.

I intend to replace it with a Unix Domain socket for local requests
and an Internet socket for remote requests. This actually has quite
far-reaching consequences apart from overcoming the above problems as:

1. You can just use "select" incorporating any required timeouts and
   kiss goodbye to all the signal stuff.

2. We don't need the separate process to handle incoming network
   requests any more. (But it would be a good candidate for threads).

3. Requests to remote machines can go straight to those machines
   rather through the local scheduler as at present (and then get sent
   to the network-handling process and put on the message queue
   there).

4. We can get rid of "xbnetserv" to handle remote requests, the API
   and the Windows Clients. Everything now talks directly to the
   scheduler. And all the client process code can be replaced by calls to
   the API. This gets rid of mountains of code all duplicated and
   doing nearly (but not quite) the same thing.

5. All the above will actually reduce the Internet port numbers
   requirement to 2 from 4.

6. We can get rid of the hand-coded curses "inch" etc done as the signal
   mechanism causes chaos on some platforms.

**** All of the above has been implemented in Xi-Batch R7

2. Re-think the message file handling stuff
-------------------------------------------

It was such a nice idea at the time that people could hand-tailor
their message files to make the display say what they want, possibly
in another language. They could also configure the keys and even the
order in which some questions were asked. Then could also change what
letters and keywords did what on command line arguments.

However there was a problem - almost no one ever used it. And the few
people that did had problems if a new release came out wiping all
their changes.

And it meant a two-stage build to build the message files and edit the
source code.

We don't have to worry about strings clogging up the source code any
more (one of the original reasons for doing it) and most sensible
compilers stick that in the text these days.

I think we'll strip all that out and use getopt for argument handling
like other humans. And we'll use gettext to do messages properly.

I wrote most of Xi-Batch R7 with a different way of handling messages
that doesn't generate new source files but I'll rewrite it to use
gettext.

3. MS-Windows clients
---------------------

This needs all re-writing not to use the hideous MFC which as well as
being hideous is about as non-Free as you can get.

Please can someone who knows how to do this do it! The MFC sources are
enclosed - please grab those and the GTK stuff and start hacking.

Actually I've mostly rewritten it all in Python and QT.

4. Browser client in PHP
------------------------

This was my first ever effort at a Web Browser interface and it shows.

It all wants rewriting in PHP and just run the standard command line
utilities - so deprecate the CGI programs or cut them down a bit and
make PHP do all the work.

5. Documentation
----------------

This needs to be translated to Texinfo format to conform to GNU
standards.

I'd be inclined to merge all the manuals together into one big happy
manual to save lots of duplicated stuff in different places to
update.

Oh yes and the new version documentation needs "de-nonexistent-ifying"
