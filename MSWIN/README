		Additional notice on Copyrights
		===============================

Many of these sources were originally produced using MS Visual Studio
and have to have fixed formats, including those of the comments, as
the files are semi-automatically generated. Many contain a specific
injunction not to edit them outside of MS Visual Studio. For this
reason copyright notices have not been included where there is any
doubt.

For the avoidance of doubt all the provisions of the above copyright
notice and the terms of GNU GPL v3 apply to everything in this
directory and to all subdirectories below it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These are actually a working set of programs, written originally for
MS Visual C++ using MFC in around 1995 together with a version of the
API library.

MFC is hugely inferior to the standard C++ library in millions of ways
for standard functions but we won't go into this here.

The original idea is to have BTQW as the client interface to
view/manage the spool queue, BTRSETW to configure parameters and
BTRW to submit jobs and accept "dragged" saved jobs. Please see the
MS Windows Interface manual for how it's supposed to work.

Please can some nice kind person come and recode all this lot,
preferably stealing the GTK+ code so the interfaces all look the same.

Please note that the original Xi-Batch and xb_* nomenclature has not
been touched so at the very least the API library needs hacking to
look like the GNUbatch one.

Also note the need to have special entries on the hosts file on the
[LU]*x boxes. The gbch-hostedit program knows about this.

Enjoy!
