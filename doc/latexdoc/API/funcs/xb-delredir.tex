int \funcnameXBdelredir{}(apiBtjob *jobp, const unsigned indx)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBdelredir{} is used to delete a redirection from a job structure string table.

The definition of the job structure is given on page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\progname{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the details of the job.

\progname{indx} is the number of the redirection. Note that any subsequent redirections are ``moved up''
one place as a result of this function and their index numbers reduced by one.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result is non-zero if successful, or zero if the string table overflowed, an likely event in the case of \funcXBdelredir{}.
