\subsection{\funcnameXBclose{}}

\begin{expara}

int \funcnameXBclose{}(const int fd)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBclose{} is used to terminate a
connection with the API.

\exampletext{fd} is a file descriptor which was previously
returned by a successful call to \funcXBopen{} or equivalent.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The function returns 0 if successful otherwise one of the error codes
listed on page \pageref{errorcodes} onwards.

In most API programs the return value is ignored as it is only likely to
report an error if an invalid API descriptor is passed.
