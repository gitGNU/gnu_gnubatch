\subsection{\funcnameXBdelarg{}}

\begin{expara}

int \funcnameXBdelarg{}(apiBtjob *jobp, const unsigned indx)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBdelarg{} is used to delete an argument from a job structure string table.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the details of the job. The definition of the job structure is given on
page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{indx} is the number of the argument being deleted. Note that all the following arguments are ``moved up'' the list and their index numbers will be reduced by one.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result is non-zero if successful, or zero if the string table overflowed, an likely event in the case of \funcXBdelarg{}.
