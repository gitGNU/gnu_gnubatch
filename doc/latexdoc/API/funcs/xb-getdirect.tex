\subsection{\funcnameXBgetdirect{}}

\begin{expara}

const char *\funcnameXBgetdirect{}(const apiBtjob *jobp)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBgetdirect{} is used to extract the
working directory of a job from the string table of the job.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the
details of the job. The definition of the job structure is given on
page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result is the working directory of the job as a
\filename{const} character string, or NULL if this is not set
(but this is almost certainly an error).
