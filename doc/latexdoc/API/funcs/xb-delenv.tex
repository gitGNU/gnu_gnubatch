\subsection{\funcnameXBdelenv{}}

\begin{expara}

int \funcnameXBdelenv{}(const apiBtjob *jobp, const char *name)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBgetenv{} is used to delete an environment variable from a job string table.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the details of the job. The definition of the job structure is given on
page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{name} is the environment variable to be deleted.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result is non-zero if successful, or zero if the string table overflowed, an unlikely event in the case of a deletion.

No error is reported if the specified variable does not exist.

\subsubsection{Notes}
Environment variables common to all jobs may be held in a ``static environment file'' to which the job
structure environment variables represent differences only. This routine will not affect entries in the static environment file.
