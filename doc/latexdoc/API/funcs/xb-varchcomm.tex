The function \funcXBvarchcomm{} is used to change the
comment which is associated with a variable

\exampletext{fd} is a file descriptor which was previously

\exampletext{flags} is 0 or
\filename{\constprefix{}FLAG\_IGNORESEQ} to ignore recent changes to
the variable list if possible.

variable as returned by \funcXBvarlist{} or
\funcXBvarfindslot{}.

\exampletext{newcomment} is the proposed new comment for the
