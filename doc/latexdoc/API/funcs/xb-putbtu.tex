The function \funcXBputbtu{} is used to update a user's profile parameters for the given host. It may
only be invoked by a user with \textit{write admin file} privilege, unless the user just wants to change his or her default modes and has
change default modes privilege. (The privileges are those applying prior to the operation).

\exampletext{fd} is a file descriptor which was previously returned by a successful call to \funcXBopen{} or equivalent.

\exampletext{username} is the name of the user, whose details are being updated.

\exampletext{ustr} is a pointer to a structure which contains the new user profile. The definition of the user profile structure is
given on page \pageref{bkm:Userstructure}.
