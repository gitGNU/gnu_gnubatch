\subsection{\funcnameXBgetenv{}}

\begin{expara}

const char *\funcnameXBgetenv{}(const apiBtjob *jobp, const char *name)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBgetenv{} is used to extract an
environment variable from a job string table.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the
details of the job. The definition of the job structure is given on
page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{name} is the environment varible required.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result is the environment variable value as a
\filename{const} character string or NULL if the variable does
not exist in the job (perhaps because it is in the static environment
file).
