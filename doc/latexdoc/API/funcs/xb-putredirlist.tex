int \funcnameXBputredirlist{}(apiBtjob *jobp,

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBputredirlist{} is used to replace
the entire redirection list for a job in one operation.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure which contains
the job details. The definition of the job structure is given on page
\pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{rdlist} is a vector of redirections.

Details of the redirection structure and fields therein are documented
under \funcXBgetredir{} on page
\pageref{bkm:redirstruct}.

\exampletext{num} is the number of elements in
\exampletext{rdlist}.

The new redirection list completely replaces the old.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The function will return non-zero if successful otherwise zero if the
string table overflowed. In the latter case the contents of the job
should no be relied upon, the job structure should be saved first if in
doubt.
