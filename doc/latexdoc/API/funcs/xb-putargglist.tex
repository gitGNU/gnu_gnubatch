\begin{expara}

int \funcnameXBputarglist{}(apiBtjob *jobp, const char **alist)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBputarglist{} is used to replace
the entire argument list within a string table of a job.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the
details of the job. The definition of the job structure is given on
page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{alist} is a vector of strings containing the new
arguments.

The new argument list completely replaces the old

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result is non-zero if successful or zero if the string table
overflowed. In the latter case the contents of the string table should
not be relied upon. The job structure should be saved first if in
doubt.

\subsection{\funcnameXBputdirect{}}

\begin{expara}

int \funcnameXBputdirect{}(apiBtjob *jobp, const char *direct)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBputdirect{} is used to insert a
new working directory name into a job structure.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the
job details. The definition of the job structure is given on page
\pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{direct} is the name of the directory to be
inserted.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result will be non-zero if successful or zero if the string table
