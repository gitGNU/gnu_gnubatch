\subsection{\funcnameXBputenvlist{}}

\begin{expara}

int \funcnameXBputenvlist{}(const apiBtjob *jobp, const char **elist)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBputenv{} is used to replace the entire environment variable list of a job string table.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the details of the job. The definition of the job structure is given on
page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{elist} is a null-terminated list of environment variables. Each should be of the form
\exampletext{NAME=VALUE}. Any entries not in this form are ignored.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result will be no-zero if successful or zero if the string table overflowed. In the latter case the string table contents of the job
should not be relied upon. The job structure should be saved first if in doubt.

\subsubsection{Notes}
Remember that these entries merely override settings in any ``static environment file'' on the server running the job.
