\end{expara}

The function \funcXBgetarg{} is used to extract an
argument string from a job string table.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the
details of the job.

The definition of the job structure is given on page
\pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{indx} is the argument number required. This should
be between 0 and 1 less than the total number of arguments (given by
the field \filename{jobp-{\textgreater}h.bj\_args}).

\subsubsection{Return values}
If successful the function will return the required argument as a
\filename{const} character string otherwise NULL if the
argument number is invalid.
