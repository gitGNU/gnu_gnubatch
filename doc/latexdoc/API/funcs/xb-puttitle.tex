\subsection{\funcnameXBputtitle{}}

\begin{expara}

int \funcnameXBputtitle{}(const int fd, apiBtjob *jobp, const char *title)

\end{expara}

The function \funcnameXBputtitle{} is used to insert a new or replacement title
into the string table of a job structure, possibly automatically
inserting the current queue name as set by \funcnameXBsetqueue{}.

\exampletext{fd} is a file descriptor which was previously
returned by a successful call to \funcXBopen{}, or -1
to disregard any queue name set by \funcnameXBsetqueue{}.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer which contains the details of
the job.

The definition of the job structure is given on page
\pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{title} is the required new title or NULL if the
title is to be deleted. If fd is a valid API descriptor, then any queue
name set by \funcXBsetqueue{} will be added to it.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result will be no-zero if successful or zero if the string table
overflowed. In the latter case the string table contents of the job
should not be relied upon. The job structure should be saved first if
in doubt.
