\subsection{\funcnameXBputarg{}}

\begin{expara}

int \funcnameXBputarg{}(apiBtjob *jobp, const unsigned indx, const char *newarg)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBputarg{} is used to replace or add
a new argument to the argument list of a job.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the
details of the job. The definition of the job structure is given on
page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{indx} is the number of the argument to be replaced
or added. This may be greater than any number of existing arguments if
required, in which case any intervening arguments are created as empty
strings.

\exampletext{newarg} is the character string containing the new
argument.

\subsubsection{Return values}
The result is non-zero if successful or zero if the string table
overflowed. In the latter case the contents of the string table should
not be relied upon. The job structure should be saved first if in
doubt.
