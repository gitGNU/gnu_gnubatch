\subsection{\funcnameXBputenv{}}

\begin{expara}

const char *\funcnameXBputenv{}(const apiBtjob *jobp, const char *name)

\end{expara}

The function \funcXBputenv{} is used to insert an
environment variable into a job string table.

\exampletext{jobp} is a pointer to a structure containing the
details of the job. The definition of the job structure is given on
page \pageref{bkm:Jobstructure} onwards.

\exampletext{name} is the environment varible required, in the
form NAME=VALUE.

\subsubsection{Return values}
This function will return non-zero if successful otherwise zero if the
string table overflowed. In the latter case the contents of the job
structure should not be relied upon. If in doubt copy the job structure
first.
