\chapter{Introduction to \ProductName{} API}
\label{chp:introduction-to-xi-batch-api}
The \ProductName{} API enables a C or C++ programmer to access \ProductName{} facilities directly from within an application. The
application may be on a Unix host or on a Windows workstation.

Communication takes place using a TCP connection between the API running on a Windows or Unix machine and the server process
\progname{xbnetserv} running on the Unix host in question. The same application may safely make several simultaneous conversations
with the same or different host.

The user may submit, change, delete and alter the state of jobs or variables to which he or she has access, and may receive notification
about changes which may require attention. In addition, the user access control parameters may be viewed and if permitted, changed.
