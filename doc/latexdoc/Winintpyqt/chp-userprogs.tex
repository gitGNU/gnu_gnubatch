\label{chp:user-programs}
There are two Programs which are installed on a Windows PC. The
installation normally sets up a Program group called \textit{\manualProduct{}
Windows Interface} in the Program Manager. The programs are described
in following chapters. Features that are common to more than one
program, like the dialog for setting job start times, are described in
one chapter.

The two programs are:

\textbf{Batch Queue Management Tool} Shows the Queue of Batch
Jobs and Set of Job Control Variables, allowing users to change them
according to the various permissions. This program also provides initialisation
facilities provided in the previous MS Windows interface as \progname{btrsetw}.

\textbf{Job Creation Tool} enables jobs to be specified and
then submitted to the Batch Queue. Jobs can also be
``unqueued'' using \progname{btqw}, then changed and
re-submitted using \progname{btrw}. Jobs can also be created and submitted from scratch.\\
