\PrXbtq{} and \PrXmbtq{} are fully interactive GTK+ Motif alternatives to
the standard queue manager \PrBtq{}. As with
\PrBtq{} the format of the screen display, the help
messages and the command keystrokes can be easily altered to suit your
requirements.

Unlike \PrBtq{} there are no specific command line
options to \PrXmbtq{}. The facility to change or
specify resources settings for an X11 (and hence Motif) program on the
command line can be used.
