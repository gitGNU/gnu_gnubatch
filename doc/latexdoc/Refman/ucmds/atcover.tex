\progname{atcover} may be used instead of the standard \progname{at(1)} command. It converts the options that most versions of the
\progname{at(1)} commands take to the equivalent \PrBtr{} commands and then invokes \PrBtr{} to submit the batch jobs.

The \PrBtr{} program provides a much greater set of facilities than \progname{at}(1). Although it is strongly
recommended to switch to the \PrBtr{} command to take advantage of these, they can be made available to users of our
\progname{atcover} command. This is done by setting up \filename{BTR} in the application or user environment.

\progname{atcover} is usually installed in place of \progname{at} in \filename{/usr/bin}, with the
original binary moved to something like \filename{old.at} in the same directory.
