\PrXbtr{} is a fully interactive GTK+ alternative and \PrXmbtr{} is a fully interactive Motif alternative to
the standard tools for submitting batch jobs, \PrBtr{} and \PrRbtr{}. Jobs are submitted from saved job files, which may have been created via
``unqueue'' from \PrBtq{}, \PrXbtq{}, \PrXmbtq{} or \PrBtjdel{}, or created afresh within \PrXbtr{} or \PrXmbtr{}.

Unlike \PrBtr{} etc there are no specific command line options to \PrXbtr{} or \PrXmbtr{}. The facility to change or specify resources settings
for an X11 (and hence GTK+ or Motif) program on the command line can be used.

Because they are set-user, you may need to turn off X11 restrictions by running:

before using \PrXbtr{} or \PrXmbtr.
