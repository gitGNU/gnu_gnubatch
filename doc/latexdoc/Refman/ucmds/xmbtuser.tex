\PrXbtuser{} and \PrXmbtuser{} are fully interactive Motif alternatives to the standard user control program \PrBtuser{}, but
only in the fully interactive mode, so it cannot be started by a user without \textit{Write admin file} privilege.

Unlike \PrBtuser{} there are no specific command line options to \PrXbtuser{} and \PrXmbtuser{} other than the ones
to interact with the X toolkit. The facility to change or specify resources settings for an X11 (and hence Motif) program on the
command line can be used.
