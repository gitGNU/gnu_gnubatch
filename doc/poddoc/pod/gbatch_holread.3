=head1 DESCRIPTION

The function B<gbatch_holread> is used to read the holiday file for the
specified year.

I<fd> is a file descriptor which was previously returned by a
successful call to gbatch_open(3).

I<flags> is currently unused but is reserved for future extensions.

I<year> is the year for which the holiday file is required.  This
should be the actual number of the year or an offset from 1990.  For
example the year 1994 could be given as 1994 or 94.  Note: The offset
value should be less than 200.

I<bitmap> is an array of characters representing the bitmap.  Bits are
set if the days is a holiday. To test the bitmap use the following
formula:

 if (bitmap[day >> 3] & (1 << (day & 7)))
   /*day is holiday*/

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The function returns 0 if successful, otherwise an error code as
defined in the include file \fBgbatch.h\fR.
