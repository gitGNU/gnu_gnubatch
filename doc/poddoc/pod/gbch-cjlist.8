=head1 NAME

gbch-cjlist - dump out GNUbatch jobs to directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gbch-cjlist>
[ I<-D dir> ]
[ I<-e n> ]
[ I<-u> ]
[ I<-s> ]
[ I<-f> ]
I<job file> I<outfile> I<workdir>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gbch-cjlist> converts B<GNUbatch> job files held in the batch spool
directory to an executable shell script which may be used to recreate
them. This may be useful for backup purposes or for one stage in
upgrading from one release of B<GNUbatch> to another.

The jobs are copied into the backup directory I<workdir>, and the
generated shell script file I<outfile> refers to files in that
directory.

In addition to options, three arguments are always supplied to
B<gbch-cjlist>.

=over 4

=item Job list file

This is the file containing the attributes of the jobs,
F<btsched_jfile> in the spool directory.

=item Output file

This file is created by B<gbch-cjlist> to contain the executable shell
script which may be used to create the jobs.

=item Backup directory

This directory is used to hold the job data.

=back

Note that saved jobs make use of the B<-U> option to gbch-r(1) to set the
ownership correctly.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -D I<directory>

Specifies the source directory for the jobs and I<job file> rather
than the current directory. It can be specified as C<$SPOOLDIR> or
C<${SPOOLDIR-/var/spool/gnubatch}> etc and the environment and/or
F<gnubatch.conf> will be interrogated to interpolate the value
of the environment variable given.

If you use this, don't forget to put single quotes around it thus:

 gbch-cjlist -D '${SPOOLDIR-/var/spool/gnubatch}' ...

otherwise the shell will try to interpret the C<$> construct and not
B<gbch-cjlist>.

=item -e I<n>

Tolerate I<n> errors of the kinds denoted by the other options before
giving up trying to convert the file.

=item -f

Ignore format errors (invalid strings etc) in the saved job file up to
the number of total errors given by the B<-e> option. Offending jobs
are skipped.

=item -s

Ignore file size errors in the saved job file (up to the number of
total errors given by the B<-e> option.

=item -u

Do not check user names in the saved job file.
