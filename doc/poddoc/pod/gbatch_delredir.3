I<indx>B<)>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The function B<gbatch_delredir> is used to delete a redirection from a job
structure string table.

I<jobp> is a pointer to a structure containing the details of the job.

I<indx> is the number of the redirection. Note that any subsequent
redirections are "moved up" one place as a result of this function and
their index numbers reduced by one.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The result is non-zero if successful, or zero if the string table
overflowed, an likely event in the case of B<gbatch_delredir>.
