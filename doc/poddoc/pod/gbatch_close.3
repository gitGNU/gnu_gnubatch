=head1 DESCRIPTION

The function B<gbatch_close> is used to terminate a connection with the API.

I<fd> is a file descriptor which was previously returned by a
successful call to gbatch_open(3).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The function returns 0 if successful, otherwise an error code as
defined in the include file \fBgbatch.h\fR.

In most API programs the return value is ignored as it is only likely
to report an error if an invalid API descriptor is passed.
