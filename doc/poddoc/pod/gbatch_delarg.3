=head1 DESCRIPTION

The function B<gbatch_delarg> is used to delete an argument from a job
structure string table.

I<jobp> is a pointer to a structure containing the details of the job.

I<indx> is the number of the argument being deleted. Note that all the
following arguments are "moved up" the list and their index numbers
will be reduced by one.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The result is non-zero if successful, or zero if the string table
overflowed, an likely event in the case of B<gbatch_delarg>.
