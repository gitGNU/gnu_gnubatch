=head1 NAME

gbch-cvlist - dump out GNUbatch variables to a shell script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gbch-cvlist>
[ I<-D dir> ]
[ I<-e n> ]
[ I<-s> ]
[ I<-f> ]
I<var file> I<outfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gbch-cvlist> converts B<GNUbatch> variables held in the batch spool
directory to an executable shell script which may be used to
re-install them. This may be useful for backup purposes or for one
stage in upgrade from one release of B<GNUbatch> to another.

In addition to options, two arguments are always supplied to
B<gbch-cvlist>.

=over 4

=item Variable list file

This is the file containing the attributes of the variables,
F<btsched_vfile> in the batch spool directory, by default
F</usr/spool/batch>, or as relocated by re-specifying C<SPOOLDIR>.

=item Output file

This file is created by B<gbch-cvlist> to contain the executable shell
script, containing gbch-var(1) commands, which may be used to recreate
the variables.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -D I<directory>

Specifies the source directory for the variables and I<var file> if
not the current directory. It can be specified as C<$SPOOLDIR> or
C<${SPOOLDIR-/var/spool/gnubatch}> etc and the environment and/or
F</etc/gnubatch.conf> will be interrogated to interpolate the value
of the environment variable given.

If you use this, don't forget to put single quotes around it thus:

 gbch-cvlist -D '${SPOOLDIR-/var/spool/gnubatch}' ...

otherwise the shell will try to interpret the C<$> construct and not
B<gbch-cvlist>.

=item -e I<n>

Tolerate I<n> errors of the kinds denoted by the other options before
giving up trying to convert the file.

=item -f

Ignore format errors in the saved variable file, skip over invalid
entries up to the limit given by the B<-e> option.

=item -s

Ignore file size errors in the saved variable file (up to the number of
total errors given by the B<-e> option).
