=head1 NAME

gbch-uconv - dump out GNUbatch user permissions to file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gbch-uconv>
[ I<-D dir> ]
[ I<-e n> ]
[ I<-s> ]
[ I<-f> ]
I<user file> I<outfile>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gbch-uconv> converts the B<GNUbatch> user file, which is usually
F<btufile> held in the batch spool directory to an
executable shell script file I<outfile>, which if executed, would
recreate the B<GNUbatch> users permissions with the same options and
privileges.

In addition to options, two arguments are always supplied to
B<gbch-cvlist>.

=over 4

=item User file

This is the file containing the attributes of the variables, F<btufile>
in the batch spool directory.

=item Output file

This file is created by B<gbch-uconv> to contain the executable shell
script, containing gbch-uchange(1) commands, which may be used to
recreate the user file.

This file should be run before restarting the scheduler.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -D I<directory>

specifies the source directory for the users and I<user file>. It can be
specified as C<$SPOOLDIR> or C<${SPOOLDIR-/var/spool/gnubatch}> etc and the
environment and/or F<gnubatch.conf> will be interrogated to
interpolate the value of the environment variable given.

If you use this, don't forget to put single quotes around it thus:

 gbch-uconv -D '${SPOOLDIR-/var/spool/gnubatch}' ...

otherwise the shell will try to interpret the C<$> construct and not
B<gbch-uconv>.

=item -e I<n>

Tolerate I<n> errors of the kinds denoted by the other options before
giving up trying to convert the file.

=item -f

Ignore format errors in the saved user file, up to the limit of errors
given by the B<-e> option.

=item -s

Ignore file size errors in the saved user file (up to the number of
total errors given by the B<-e> option.
