<br>

B<int gbatch_varlist(const int>
I<fd>B<, const unsigned>
I<flags>B<, int *>
I<numvars>B<, slotno_t **>I<slots>B<)>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The function B<gbatch_varlist> is used to obtain a vector of slots which
can be used to access the details of variables readable by the user.

I<fd> is a file descriptor which was previously returned by a
successful call to gbatch_open(3).

I<flags> is zero, or a logical OR of one or more of the following values

=over 4

=item GBATCH_FLAG_LOCALONLY

Ignore remote variables/hosts, i.e. not local to the server, not the client.

=item GBATCH_FLAG_USERONLY

Restrict to the user only.

=item GBATCH_FLAG_GROUPONLY

Restrict to the current group (possibly as selected by gbatch_newgrp(3))
only.

=back

I<numvars> is a pointer to an integer which will contain the number of variables in the list.

I<slots> is a pointer to an array of slots. The memory used by this
list should not be freed by the user as it is owned by the API.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The function returns 0 if successful, otherwise an error code as
defined in the include file \fBgbatch.h\fR.
