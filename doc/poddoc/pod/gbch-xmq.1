gbch-xmq - X/Motif batch queue view

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gbch-xmq>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gbch-xmq> is a fully interactive Motif alternative to the standard
queue manager gbch-q(1). As with gbch_q(1) the format of the screen display,
the help messages and the command keystrokes can be easily altered to
suit your requirements.

Unlike gbch-q(1) there are no specific command line options to
B<gbch-xmq>. The facility to change or specify resources settings for an
X11 (and hence Motif) program on the command line can be used.
