B<gbch-xmuser> is a fully interactive Motif alternative to the standard
user control program gbch-user(1), but only in the fully interactive
mode, so it cannot be started by a user without I<Write admin file>
privilege.

Unlike gbch-user(1) there are no specific command line options to
B<gbch-xmuser>. The facility to change or specify resources settings for an
X11 (and hence Motif) program on the command line can be used.
