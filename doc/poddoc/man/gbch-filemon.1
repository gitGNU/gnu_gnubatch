.SH "NAME"
gbch\-filemon \- monitor for changes to files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBgbch-filemon\fR
[ \fI\-options\fR ]
.PP
\&\fBgbch-xfilemon\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgbch-filemon\fR executes a given program or script when specified files
change in specified ways in a specified directory.
.PP
It is intentionally not integrated with the \fBGNUbatch\fR core product,
as there is no automatic mechanism within Unix for signalling changes
to files, and it is therefore necessary to \*(L"poll\*(R" or monitor the files
aaat a given interval. \fBgbch-filemon\fR is made as small as possible so
that the \*(L"polling\*(R" does not have a large impact on the system.
.PP
The rest of \fBGNUbatch\fR is made to be \*(L"event-driven\*(R", as this has
minimal impact on the system when the product is inactive.
.PP
The \*(L"action\*(R" of \fBgbch-filemon\fR may be to run a \fBGNUbatch\fR job, set a
variable, or perform some completely unrelated task.
.PP
\&\fBGbch-filemon\fR may optionally be used to list or terminate running
copies of itself.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The \s-1GTK\s0 program \fIgbch\-xfilemon\fR\|(1) or the X/Motif program
\&\fIgbch\-xmfilemon\fR\|(1) may be used to set up the options to and run
\&\fBgbch-filemon\fR rather than remembering them here.
.PP
Note that the order of treatment, letters and keywords described below
may be modified by editing the file \fIfilemon.help\fR \-
see \fIbtsyntax\fR\|(5).
.PP
The environment variable on which options are supplied is \f(CW\*(C`GBCH_FILEMON\*(C'\fR
and the environment variable to specify the help file is \f(CW\*(C`FILEMONCONF\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-? or +explain" 8
.IX Item "-? or +explain"
causes a summary of the other options to be displayed without taking
further action.
.IP "\-A or +file\-arrives" 8
.IX Item "-A or +file-arrives"
Perform the required action when a new file is detected in the
directory.
.IP "\-a or +any\-file" 8
.IX Item "-a or +any-file"
Perform the required action for any file name.
.IP "\-C or +continue\-running" 8
.IX Item "-C or +continue-running"
Continue \fBgbch-filemon\fR after a matching file and condition has been
found, looking for further files.
.IP "\-c \fIcommand\fR" 8
.IX Item "-c command"
Specify \fIcommand\fR to execute when one of the monitored events
occurs. This is an alternative to \fB\-X\fR, which runs a named shell
script.
.Sp
In the \fIcommand\fR the sequence \fB\f(CB%f\fB\fR is replaced by the name of the
file whose activity has provoked the action, and \fB\f(CB%d\fB\fR by the
directory.
.Sp
To use this option, be sure to enclose the whole shell command in
quotes so that it is passed as one argument, thus:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \-c "xmessage \-bg red \*(AqFound %f\*(Aq"
.Ve
.IP "\-D \fIdir\fR or +directory \fIdir\fR" 8
.IX Item "-D dir or +directory dir"
Specify the given \fIdir\fR as the directory to monitor rather than the
current directory.
.IP "\-d or +daemon\-process" 8
.IX Item "-d or +daemon-process"
Detach a futher \fBgbch-filemon\fR as a daemon process, and return to the
user.
.IP "\-e or +include\-existing" 8
.IX Item "-e or +include-existing"
Include existing files in the scan, and report changes etc to
those. If the \fB\-A\fR option (watch for file arriving), this will have
no effect unless an existing file is deleted and is recreated.
.IP "\-G \fIsecs\fR or +file\-stops\-growing \fIsecs\fR" 8
.IX Item "-G secs or +file-stops-growing secs"
Activate command when a file has appeared, and has not grown further
for at least \fIsecs\fR. Distinguish this from the \fB\-M\fR option, which
will check for any change, possibly in the middle of a file.
.IP "\-I \fIsecs\fR or +file\-stops\-changing \fIsecs\fR" 8
.IX Item "-I secs or +file-stops-changing secs"
Activate command when a file has appeared, and has not been changed
for at least \fIsecs\fR. This is more inclusive than \fB\-M\fR, as it
includes activities such as changing the ownership or mode of the
file, or making hard links.
.IP "\-i or +ignore\-existing" 8
.IX Item "-i or +ignore-existing"
Ignore existing files (default). However if an existing file is noted
to have been deleted, and then re-created, the new version will be
treated as a new file.
.IP "\-K or +kill\-all" 8
.IX Item "-K or +kill-all"
Kill all \fBgbch-filemon\fR daemon processes belonging to the user, or all
processes if invoked by \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-k \fIdir\fR or +kill\-processes \fIdir\fR" 8
.IX Item "-k dir or +kill-processes dir"
Kill any \fBgbch-filemon\fR daemon processes left running which are scanning
the given directory. Processes must belong to the invoking user, or
\&\fBgbch-filemon\fR be invoked by \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-L or +follow\-links" 8
.IX Item "-L or +follow-links"
Follow symbolic links to files (and subdirectories with the \fB\-R\fR
option).
.IP "\-l or +list\-processes" 8
.IX Item "-l or +list-processes"
List running \fBgbch-filemon\fR processes and which directories they are
accessing.
.IP "\-M \fIsecs\fR or +file\-stops\-writing \fIsecs\fR" 8
.IX Item "-M secs or +file-stops-writing secs"
Activate command when a file has appeared, and has not been written to
for at least \fIsecs\fR.  This is more inclusive than B\-G>, as it
includes writes other than to the end of the file. It is less
inclusive than \fB\-I\fR, which also monitors for linking and
permission-changing.
.IP "\-m or +run\-monitor" 8
.IX Item "-m or +run-monitor"
Run as a file monitor program (default) rather than \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-k\fR or
\&\fB\-K\fR.
.IP "\-n or +not\-daemon" 8
.IX Item "-n or +not-daemon"
Do not detach \fBgbch-filemon\fR as a daemon process (default), wait and
only return to the user when a file event has been detected.
.IP "\-P \fIsecs\fR or +poll\-time \fIsecs\fR" 8
.IX Item "-P secs or +poll-time secs"
Poll directory every \fIsecs\fR seconds. This should be sufficiently
small not to \*(L"miss\*(R" events for a long time, but large enough to not
load the system. The default if this is not specified is 20 seconds.
.IP "\-p \fIpattern\fR or +pattern\-file \fIpattern\fR" 8
.IX Item "-p pattern or +pattern-file pattern"
Perform action on a file name matching \fIpattern\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIPattern\fR may take the form of wild-card matching given by the shell,
with \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[a\-z]\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[!a\-z]\*(C'\fR having the same meanings as with
the shell, and possible alternative patterns separated by commas, for
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& \-p \*(Aq*.[chyl],*.obj\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
Remember to enclose the argument in quotes so that it is interpreted
by \fBgbch-filemon\fR and not the shell.
.IP "\-R or +recursive" 8
.IX Item "-R or +recursive"
Recursively follow subdirectories of the starting directory.
.IP "\-r or +file\-deleted" 8
.IX Item "-r or +file-deleted"
Perform action when a file matching the criteria has been deleted.
.IP "\-S or +halt\-when\-found" 8
.IX Item "-S or +halt-when-found"
Halt \fBgbch-filemon\fR once a matching file and condition has been found.
.IP "\-s \fIfile\fR or +specific\-file \fIfile\fR" 8
.IX Item "-s file or +specific-file file"
Perform action only with a specific named file, not a pattern.
.IP "\-u \fIsecs\fR or +file\-stops\-use \fIsecs\fR" 8
.IX Item "-u secs or +file-stops-use secs"
Perform action when a file has appeared, and has not been read
for at least \fIsecs\fR.
.IP "\-X \fIscript\fR" 8
.IX Item "-X script"
Specify the given \fIscript\fR as a shell script to execute when one of
the monitored events occurs. This is an alternative to \fB\-c\fR. The
existence of the shell script is checked, and \fBgbch-filemon\fR will fail
with an error message if it does not exist.
.Sp
The shell script is passed the following arguments:
.RS 8
.IP "1." 4
File name
.IP "2." 4
Directory path
.IP "3." 4
File size (or last file size if file deleted).
.IP "4." 4
Date of file modification, change or access as \s-1YYYY/MM/DD\s0, but only
for those type of changes.
.IP "5." 4
Time of file modification, change or access as \s-1HH:MM:SS\s0, but only
for those type of changes.
.RE
.RS 8
.RE
.IP "+freeze\-current" 8
.IX Item "+freeze-current"
Save all the current options in a \fI.gnubatch\fR file in the current
directory with keyword \f(CW\*(C`BTFILEMON\*(C'\fR. If this is specified,
\&\fBgbch-filemon\fR will terminate after saving the file.
.IP "+freeze\-home" 8
.IX Item "+freeze-home"
Save all the current options in a \fI.gnubatch\fR file in the user's home
directory. If this is specified, \fBgbch-filemon\fR will terminate after
saving the file.
.SS "File matching"
.IX Subsection "File matching"
What to look for may be made to depend upon something happening to
.IP "Any file" 8
.IX Item "Any file"
With the \fB\-a\fR option. Any file that meets the other criteria will
trigger the event.
.IP "Specific file" 8
.IX Item "Specific file"
With the \fB\-s\fR option, \fBgbch-filemon\fR will watch for the specific file
named.
.IP "Pattern" 8
.IX Item "Pattern"
With the \fB\-p\fR option, a file which matches the pattern and the other
criteria will trigger the action.
.SS "Criteria"
.IX Subsection "Criteria"
There are 6 criteria to watch for.
.IP "File arriving" 8
.IX Item "File arriving"
This is probably the most common case. If you want to wait for a file
being written and trigger an event, the \fB\-A\fR option will look for
this.
.IP "File removal" 8
.IX Item "File removal"
This will watch for files being deleted, for example some applications
use a \*(L"lock file\*(R" to denote that they are being run, and you might
wish to start something else when it has gone.
.Sp
Remember that you might want to include existing files in the scan
with \fB\-e\fR if the file in question existed when you started
\&\fBgbch-filemon\fR.
.IP "File stopped growing" 8
.IX Item "File stopped growing"
What this watches for is for a file being having been created, or with
the \fB\-e\fR option starting to \*(L"grow\*(R", and then apparently no longer
grown for the given time.
.Sp
If files are arriving from \s-1FTP\s0, for example, then when they are
complete, they will cease to \*(L"grow\*(R" in size.
.IP "File no longer written" 8
.IX Item "File no longer written"
A file not used sequentially may be written to internally rather than
have additional data appended. This often occurs with database files,
where records are updated somewhere in the middle of the file. If a
series of database transactions is made and then completed, the file
will no longer be written to for some time, and \fBgbch-filemon\fR can be
made to trigger an action after that time.
.Sp
You will often want to include the \fB\-e\fR option if the file existed
already on entry.
.IP "File no longer changed" 8
.IX Item "File no longer changed"
This goes a stage further than \*(L"no longer written\*(R" as it includes any
kind of change to the file, such as permissions, owner, hard links or
change of access and write times.
.IP "File no longer used" 8
.IX Item "File no longer used"
This monitors the access time of the file, updated whenever the file
is read, and proceeds when this has gone unchanged for the specified
time.
.Sp
You will often want to include the \fB\-e\fR option with this if the file
existed already on entry.
.SS "Pre-existing files"
.IX Subsection "Pre-existing files"
If the \fB\-i\fR (ignore existing) option is specified, which is the
default, then no changes to existing files which would otherwise match
the criteria will be considered, except where an existing file is
deleted and then recreated and \fBgbch-filemon\fR \*(L"notices\*(R" this happen, in
that the file is deleted before one \*(L"poll\*(R" of the directory and
recreated before another. In other words, if the poll time is 20
seconds, then the deletion and recreation will have to be 20 seconds
apart.
.PP
If the \fB\-e\fR option to include existing files is specified, the \fB\-G\fR,
\&\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-M\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-r\fR options will work as for new files but
not \fB\-A\fR, as the file has already \*(L"arrived\*(R". However, if it is
deleted, this is \*(L"noticed\*(R" and then recreated, it will be treated as a
\&\*(L"new\*(R" file.
.SS "Recursive searches"
.IX Subsection "Recursive searches"
If recursive searches are specified using the \fB\-R\fR option, a separate
\&\fBgbch-filemon\fR process will be invoked for each subdirectory, for
each further subdirectory within each of those subdirectories, and for
each new subdirectory created within one of those whilst each process
is running, unless the \fB\-r\fR option is being used to watch for file
removal, whereupon only those subdirectories which existed to begin
with will be considered.
.PP
If the \fB\-S\fR option is specified to stop once a file has been found,
each process will continue until a file is found in its particular
subdirectory.
