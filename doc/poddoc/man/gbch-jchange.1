gbch\-jchange \- change batch jobs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBgbch-jchange\fR
[ \fI\-options\fR ]
\&\fIjob number\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgbch-jchange\fR is a program to modify details of a job or jobs from a
shell script or another program. Jobs are specified by using the job
number, as displayed by \fIgbch\-r\fR\|(1) with the \fB\-v\fR (verbose) option, or as
in the output of the first column of the \fIgbch\-jlist\fR\|(1) command with
default format.
.PP
Remote jobs should be specified by prefixing the job numbers with the
host name thus:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        host:1234
.Ve
.PP
It is not necessary to specify any leading zeros.
.PP
Several jobs may be specified at once to apply the same set of changes
to all of them at once.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
As supplied, the options to \fBgbch-jchange\fR are more or less identical to
those for \fBgbch-r\fR, except that existing jobs have their parameters
changed from whatever they are to the specified parameters, and there
is no \*(L"default\*(R", in that mentioning an option means that the user
requires an existing parameter for the job or jobs changed. For
details of the syntax and much of the meaning of the options, please
see the documentation of \fIgbch\-r\fR\|(1) at the corresponding option.
.PP
It is a mistake not to specify any options at all.
.PP
Note that the order of treatment, letters and keywords described below
may be modified by editing the file \fIbtrest.help\fR \- see
\&\fIbtsyntax\fR\|(5).
.PP
The environment variable on which options are supplied is \f(CW\*(C`GBCH_JCHANGE\*(C'\fR and the
environment variable to specify the help file is \f(CW\*(C`BTRESTCONF\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-? or +explain" 4
.IX Item "-? or +explain"
causes a summary of the other options to be displayed without taking
further action.
.IP "\-2 \fItime\fR or +grace\-time \fItime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-2 time or +grace-time time"
change the secondary maximum run time to \fItime\fR seconds (\fItime\fR may
be a number of seconds, or \fImm:ss\fR for minutes and seconds).
.IP "\-9 or +catch\-up" 4
.IX Item "-9 or +catch-up"
change the \*(L"if not possible\*(R" action of the job or jobs to \*(L"catch up\*(R".
.IP "\-A \fIdays\fR or +avoiding\-days \fIdays\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A days or +avoiding-days days"
signifies days to avoid when the job or jobs are repeated. The
interpretation of the option syntax, and default days is just the same
as for \fIgbch\-r\fR\|(1), but the existing \*(L"days to avoid\*(R" in each job is
replaced completely with the result. For example, the default days are
\&\f(CW\*(C`Sat\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Sun\*(C'\fR, so
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-A ,Wed
.Ve
.Sp
Will incorporate the default days to avoid taken from the help file,
adding Wednesday and change the days to avoid in the job or jobs to
Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday.
.IP "\-a \fIstring\fR or +argument \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a string or +argument string"
Specify an argument for the job or jobs. The argument will be added to
the end of the arguments already in the job or jobs or added by
previous \fB\-a\fR arguments to \fBgbch-jchange\fR unless the \fB\-e\fR option is
used, which will discard any pre-existing arguments in the job or
jobs as well as any previously-specified \fB\-a\fR arguments.
.IP "\-B or +assignment\-not\-critical" 4
.IX Item "-B or +assignment-not-critical"
Marks subsequently specified assignments as \*(L"not critical\*(R", i.e. an
assignment of a variable on an inaccessible remote host will be
ignored. Existing assignments are not affected.
.IP "\-b or +assignment\-critical" 4
.IX Item "-b or +assignment-critical"
Marks subsequent assignments as \*(L"critical\*(R", i.e. an assignment of a
variable on an inaccessible remote host will cause the job to be held
up. Existing assignments are not affected.
.IP "\-C or +cancelled" 4
.IX Item "-C or +cancelled"
Sets the job or jobs to \*(L"cancelled\*(R" state.
.IP "\-c \fIcondition\fR or +condition \fIcondition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c condition or +condition condition"
Sets a condition on the job or jobs. This will add an extra condition
to existing conditions in the job or jobs or preceding \fB\-c\fR unless
the \fB\-y\fR option is given to discard any previously-specified conditions.

liable to run on the machine which they are on.
.IP "\-f \fIflags\fR or +flags\-for\-set \fIflags\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f flags or +flags-for-set flags"
Sets the flags which determine when an assignment is performed for
subsequent \fB\-s\fR options. Will not affect any existing assigments.
.IP "\-G or +full\-export" 4
.IX Item "-G or +full-export"
Marks the job or jobs to be visible throughout the network and
potentially available to run on any machine.
.IP "\-g \fIgroup\fR or +set\-group \fIgroup\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g group or +set-group group"
Resets the group owner of the job or jobs to \fIgroup\fR.
.Sp
Note that the setting of the group is done as a separate operation
from any other changes. Depending upon whether the pre-existing and
new modes and ownership permit the various operations, this may need
to be done before, after or interleaved with other changes for it to
succeed.
.IP "\-H or +hold\-current" 4
.IX Item "-H or +hold-current"
sets the \*(L"if not possible\*(R" action of the job or jobs to hold current \- the
run is done when it is possible without affecting subsequent runs.

.IX Item "-i name or +interpreter name"
Sets the command interpreter for the job or jobs to be \fIname\fR. This
will also reset the load level of the job or jobs to be that of the
command interpreter. If the load level is to be different from this
value, use the \fB\-l\fR option after this option.
.IP "\-J or +no\-advance\-time\-error" 4
.IX Item "-J or +no-advance-time-error"
Sets the flag so that if the job or jobs exit with an error, the next time to
run is not advanced.
.IP "\-j or +advance\-time\-error" 4

Sets the flag so that if the job or jobs exit with an error, the next
time to run is still advanced if applicable.
.IP "\-K or +condition\-not\-critical" 4
.IX Item "-K or +condition-not-critical"
Marks subsequent conditions as \*(L"not critical\*(R", i.e. a condition dependent
on a variable on an inaccessible remote host will be ignored. Does not
affect any conditions already defined.
.IP "\-k or +condition\-critical" 4
.IX Item "-k or +condition-critical"
Marks subsequent conditions as \*(L"critical\*(R", i.e. a condition dependent

.IX Item "-M modes or +mode modes"
Sets the permissions of the job or jobs to be \fImodes\fR. The format of
the \fImodes\fR argument is defined in more detail below.
.Sp
Note that the setting of the mode is done as a separate operation from
any other changes. Depending upon whether the pre-existing and new
modes and ownership permit the various operations, this may need to be
done before, after or interleaved with other changes to succeed.
.IP "\-m or +mail\-message" 4
.IX Item "-m or +mail-message"
Sets the flag whereby completion messages are mailed to the owner of
the job or jobs.

.IP "\-u \fIuser\fR or +set\-owner \fIuser\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u user or +set-owner user"
Resets the owner of the job or jobs to \fIuser\fR.
.Sp
Note that the setting of the user is done as a separate operation from
any other changes. Depending upon whether the pre-existing and new
modes and ownership permit the various operations, this may need to be
done before, after or interleaved with other changes to succeed.
.IP "\-W \fIsig\fR or +which\-signal \fIsig\fR" 4
.IX Item "-W sig or +which-signal sig"
Sets the signal to kill the job or jobs after the maximum run time has
been exceeded.
.IP "\-w or +write\-message" 4
.IX Item "-w or +write-message"

.SS "Mode arguments"
.IX Subsection "Mode arguments"
<a name=\*(L"Change_mode_argument\*(R"></a>
The argument to the \fB\-M\fR option provides for a wide variety of
operations.
.PP
Each permission is represented by a letter, as follows:
.IP "R" 4
.IX Item "R"
read permission
.IP "W" 4
.IX Item "W"
write permission
.IP "S" 4
.IX Item "S"
reveal permission
.IP "M" 4
.IX Item "M"
read mode
.IP "P" 4
.IX Item "P"
set mode
.IP "U" 4
.IX Item "U"
give away owner
.IP "V" 4
.IX Item "V"
assume owner
.IP "G" 4
.IX Item "G"
give away group
.IP "H" 4
.IX Item "H"
assume group
.IP "D" 4
.IX Item "D"
delete
.IP "K" 4
.IX Item "K"
kill
.PP
Each section of the mode (user, group, others) is represented by the
prefixes \f(CW\*(C`U:\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`G:\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`O:\*(C'\fR and separated by commas.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-M U:RWSMPDK,G:RWSDK,O:RS
.Ve
.PP
would set the permissions for the user, group and others as given. If
the prefixes are omitted, as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-M RWSDK
.Ve
.PP
then all of the job, group and other permissions are set to the same
value.
.PP
An alternative format allows permissions to be added to the existing
permissions, thus
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-M U:+WD,G:+D
.Ve
.PP
will add the relevant permissions to whatever is currently set.
.PP
Similarly permissions may be cancelled individually by constructs of
the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-M G:\-W,O:\-RS
.Ve
.PP
If the same operation is to be done with two or more of \f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`G\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`O\*(C'\fR, the letters may be run together, for example
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-M GO:+W
.Ve
.SS "Note on mode and owner changes"
.IX Subsection "Note on mode and owner changes"
Changing various parameters, the mode (permissions), the owner and the
group are done as separate operations.
.PP
In some cases changing the mode may prevent the next operation from
taking place. In other cases it may need to be done first.
.PP
Similar considerations apply to changes of the owner and the group.
.PP
\&\fBBtjchange\fR does not attempt to work out the appropriate order to
perform the operations, the user should execute separate \fBgbch-jchange\fR
commands in sequence to achieve the desired effect.
