\&\fBgbch-rr\fR
[ \fI\-options\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgbch-r\fR creates a \fBGNUbatch\fR batch job from each of the supplied files
or the standard input if no file names are given.
.PP
\&\fBgbch-rr\fR operates similarly, but creates the jobs on a remote host
without the necessity of having to have \fBGNUbatch\fR running on the
submitting host.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Except for the \fB\-Q\fR option, which must be specified, and the options
keyword used to pick up default arguments and to save with the
\&\fB+freeze\-current\fR and \fB+freeze\-home\fR options, the (standard \- it
would be possible to make them different by editing the option
definitions in \fIbtrest.help\fR but this would not be
sensible) options to \fBgbch-rr\fR are identical in effect to those for
\&\fBgbch-r\fR.
.PP
Note that the order of treatment, letters and keywords described below
may be modified by editing the file \fIbtrest.help\fR \-
see \fIbtsyntax\fR\|(5).
.PP
The environment variable on which options are supplied is \f(CW\*(C`GBCH_R\*(C'\fR for
\&\fBgbch-r\fR, \f(CW\*(C`GBCH_RR\*(C'\fR for \fBgbch-rr\fR and the environment variable to specify the
help file is \f(CW\*(C`BTRESTCONF\*(C'\fR.
.PP
We regret having run out of single letters for options to \fBgbch-r\fR
and \fBgbch-rr\fR and having had to resort in three cases to
non-alphabetic options.
.IP "\-? or +explain" 4
.IX Item "-? or +explain"
causes a summary of the other options to be displayed without taking
further action.
.IP "\-2 \fItime\fR or +grace\-time \fItime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-2 time or +grace-time time"
Sets the second stage time of handling over-running jobs to \fItime\fR,
in seconds (the argument may be any number of seconds, or given as
\&\f(CW\*(C`mm:ss\*(C'\fR for minutes and seconds).
.Sp
This only applies if a maximum elapsed time for a job is set with the
\&\fB\-Y\fR option. If a non-zero time is also given with this option, the
job is first killed with the signal number given by the \fB\-W\fR option
and then, if it continues to run for the time given by this argument,
killed with \f(CW\*(C`SIGKILL\*(C'\fR which cannot be caught or ignored.
.IP "\-9 or +catch\-up" 4
.IX Item "-9 or +catch-up"
sets the \*(L"if not possible\*(R" action of the job or jobs to catch up \- one
run of a series of missed runs is done when it is possible without
affecting future runs.
.IP "\-. or +done" 4
.IX Item "-. or +done"
sets the job or jobs to \*(L"done\*(R" state (this is mainly intended for
resubmitting jobs which have been \*(L"unqueued\*(R").
.IP "\-A \fIdays\fR or +avoiding\-days \fIdays\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A days or +avoiding-days days"
signifies days to avoid when the job or jobs are to be repeated
automatically. The days to avoid option supersedes any preceding or
default option, unless a leading comma is given. Thus if the existing
days to avoid are \f(CW\*(C`Sat\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Sun\*(C'\fR, the default when installed,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& gbch\-r \-A Wed
.Ve
.Sp
will change the days to avoid to be Wednesday only, whereas
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& gbch\-r \-A ,Wed
.Ve
.Sp
will change the days to avoid to be Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday.
.Sp
A single \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR argument cancels the days to avoid parameter altogether,
thus \f(CW\*(C`\-A\-\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Note that this parameter only affects \fIautomatic\fR repetitions, so if
the date given by the \fB\-T\fR parameter falls on a day excluded by this
argument, it will not be affected and the first run will be on the
date specified.
.Sp
Upon installation the default abbreviations for the days are \f(CW\*(C`Sun\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`Mon\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Tue\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Wed\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Thu\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Fri\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Sat\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Hday\*(C'\fR, the last
refers to holidays as specified in the holiday file. The days are
interpreted case-insensitively, but on saving options with
\&\fB+freeze\-current\fR or \fB+freeze\-home\fR will save the names in the
initial capital format.
.IP "\-a \fIstring\fR or +argument \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a string or +argument string"
Provide an argument string to the command interpreter. Successive
\&\fB\-a\fR options are cumulative and append additional arguments to the
list of arguments for the job or jobs. To clear previously-specified
options (maybe set in \fI.gnubatch\fR files) and start afresh, use the
\&\fB\-e\fR option first.
.IP "\-B or +assignment\-not\-critical" 4
.IX Item "-B or +assignment-not-critical"
Marks subsequently-specified assignments (with the \fB\-s\fR option) as
\&\*(L"not critical\*(R", meaning that the assignment will be ignored if it
contains a reference to a variable on a remote host which is offline
or inaccessible. This must precede the \fB\-s\fR options to which it is to
be applied.
.IP "\-b or +assignment\-critical" 4
.IX Item "-b or +assignment-critical"
Marks subsequently-specified assignments (with the \fB\-s\fR option) as
\&\*(L"critical\*(R", meaning that the job or jobs will not start if the
assignment contains a reference to a variable on a remote host which
is offline or inaccessible. This must precede the \fB\-s\fR options to
which is to be applied.
.IP "\-C or +cancelled" 4
.IX Item "-C or +cancelled"
Sets the job or jobs to be in \*(L"cancelled\*(R" state.
.IP "\-c \fIcondition\fR or +condition \fIcondition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c condition or +condition condition"
Sets a \fIcondition\fR to be satisfied before the job or jobs may
run. Successive \fB\-c\fR options cause further conditions to be appended
to the list, up to a maximum of 10 conditions. To start from scratch,
deleting any previously-specified conditions (in a \fI.gnubatch\fR file
perhaps), use the \fB\-y\fR option first.
.IP "\-D \fIdirectory\fR or +directory \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D directory or +directory directory"
Sets the working directory for the job or jobs. This may include
environment variable references preceded by \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR to be expanded and
constructs such as \f(CW\*(C`~user\*(C'\fR to select the given user's home
directory. (Remember, if using the shell, and using these constructs,
to put quotes around the directory, otherwise the shell will expand
the constructs and not \fBGNUbatch\fR).
.Sp
If omitted, then the current directory at the time of invoking \fBgbch-r\fR
or \fBgbch-rr\fR is used.
.IP "\-d or +delete\-at\-end" 4
.IX Item "-d or +delete-at-end"
cancels any repeat option of the jobs so that they will be deleted at
the end of the run rather than repeated or kept. This is the default
if no arguments are specified.
.IP "\-E or +local\-environment" 4
.IX Item "-E or +local-environment"
set the environment variables to be as per the local environment
rather than the remote environment. This applies to \fBgbch-rr\fR only and
is ignored in \fBgbch-r\fR.
.IP "\-e or +cancel\-arguments" 4
.IX Item "-e or +cancel-arguments"
deletes any arguments set up by previous options.
.IP "\-F or +export" 4
.IX Item "-F or +export"
marks the job or jobs to be visible throughout the network, but only
available to run on the machine which they are queued on.
.IP "\-f \fIletters\fR or +flags\-for\-set" 4
.IX Item "-f letters or +flags-for-set"
Precede \fB\-s\fR (set assignment) options with this and an argument
consisting of some or all of \f(CW\*(C`SNEACR\*(C'\fR (for respectively Start, Normal
exit, Error exit, Abort, Cancel and Reverse) to set the flags which
determine when an assignment is performed.
.IP "\-G or +full\-export" 4
.IX Item "-G or +full-export"
marks the job or jobs to be visible throughout the network and
potentially available to run on any machine.
.IP "\-g \fIgroup\fR or +set\-group \fIgroup\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g group or +set-group group"
set the group owner of the job or jobs to be \fIgroup\fR. The user must have
\&\fIwrite admin file\fR permission to invoke this argument.
.IP "\-H or +hold\-current" 4
.IX Item "-H or +hold-current"
sets the \*(L"if not possible\*(R" action of the job or jobs to hold current \- the
run is done when it is possible without affecting subsequent runs.
.IP "\-h \fItitle\fR or +title \fItitle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h title or +title title"
sets the title of the job or jobs to \fItitle\fR. In the absence of this
argument the title will be that of the last part of the file name, if
any. The title may be a string of any length containing any printable
characters.
.IP "\-I \fIredirection\fR or +input\-output \fIredirection\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I redirection or +input-output redirection"
sets a redirection for the job or jobs. Successive \fB\-I\fR options are
cumulative and will append to the current list of redirections. To
start the list of redirections from scratch, precede them with the
\&\fB\-Z\fR option.
.IP "\-i \fIname\fR or +interpreter \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i name or +interpreter name"
sets the command interpreter for the job or jobs to be \fIname\fR. The
load level is also set to that for the interpreter, so if a \fB\-l\fR
argument is to be specified, it should \fIfollow\fR the \fB\-i\fR argument.
.Sp
The command interpreter will be rejected if its load level exceeds the
maximum per job for a user.
.IP "\-J or +no\-advance\-time\-error" 4
.IX Item "-J or +no-advance-time-error"
sets the flag so that if the job exits with an error, the next time to
run is not advanced according to the repeat specification.
.IP "\-j or +advance\-time\-error" 4
.IX Item "-j or +advance-time-error"
sets the flag so that if the job exits with an error, the next time to
run is still advanced if applicable. This is the default if no arguments are specified.
.IP "\-K or +condition\-not\-critical" 4
.IX Item "-K or +condition-not-critical"
marks subsequently specified conditions set with the \fB\-c\fR option as
\&\*(L"not critical\*(R", i.e. a condition dependent on a variable on an offline
or otherwise inaccessible remote host will be ignored in deciding
whether a job may start. This is the default if no arguments are specified.
.IP "\-k or +condition\-critical" 4
.IX Item "-k or +condition-critical"
marks subsequently specified conditions set with the \fB\-c\fR option as
\&\*(L"critical\*(R", i.e. a condition dependent on a variable on an offline or
otherwise inaccessible remote host will cause the job to be held up.
.IP "\-L \fIvalue\fR or +ulimit \fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L value or +ulimit value"
sets the \fIulimit\fR value of the job or jobs to the value given.
.IP "\-l \fInumber\fR or +loadlev \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l number or +loadlev number"
sets the load level of the job or jobs to be \fInumber\fR. The user must
have \fIspecial create permission\fR for this to differ from that of the
command interpreter and further the load level must be less than the
maximum per job for a user. The load level is also reset by the \fB\-i\fR
(set command interpreter) option, so this must be used before the
\&\fB\-l\fR option.
.IP "\-M \fImodes\fR or +mode \fImodes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M modes or +mode modes"
sets the permissions of the job or jobs to be \fImodes\fR.
.IP "\-m or +mail\-message" 4
.IX Item "-m or +mail-message"
sets the flag whereby completion messages are mailed to the owner of
the job. (They may anyway if the jobs output to standard output or
standard error and these are not redirected).
.IP "\-N or +normal" 4
.IX Item "-N or +normal"
sets the job or jobs to normal \*(L"ready to run\*(R" state, as opposed to
\&\*(L"cancelled\*(R" as set by the \fB\-C\fR option.  This is the default if no
arguments are specified.
.IP "\-n or +local\-only" 4
.IX Item "-n or +local-only"
marks the job or jobs to be local only to the machines which they are
queued on. They will not be visible or runnable on remote hosts.
.IP "\-O or +remote\-environment" 4
.IX Item "-O or +remote-environment"
initialise the environment variables to be those from the remote
environment. This applies to \fBgbch-rr\fR only and is ignored in \fBgbch-r\fR.
This is the default if no arguments are specified.
.IP "\-o or +no\-repeat" 4
.IX Item "-o or +no-repeat"
cancels any repeat option of the job or jobs, so that the they will be
run and retained on the queue marked \f(CW\*(C`done\*(C'\fR at the end.
.IP "\-P \fIvalue\fR or +umask \fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P value or +umask value"
sets the umask value of the job or jobs to the \fIoctal\fR value given.
The value should be up to 3 octal digits as per the shell.
.IP "\-p \fInumber\fR or +priority \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p number or +priority number"
sets the priority of the job or jobs to be \fInumber\fR, which must be in
the range given by the user's minimum and maximum priority.
.IP "\-Q \fIhostname\fR or +host \fIhostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Q hostname or +host hostname"
send the job or jobs to the given \fIhostname\fR. Note that \fIhostname\fR
must be in \fIgnubatch.hosts\fR on the submitting machine and the
submitting machine's hostname must be in \fI/etc/\fR on the
receiving machine.
.Sp
If specified with \fBgbch-r\fR, the effect is to invoke \fBgbch-rr\fR with the
same command-line options as were given to \fBgbch-r\fR. Note that this does
not include any options for \fBgbch-r\fR extracted from the environment or
\&\fI.gnubatch\fR files.
.Sp
This option is \fImandatory\fR for \fBgbch-rr\fR and it will fail if it is not
specified. \fBgbch-r\fR is not invoked as otherwise there might be an
endless loop of calls (with \fB\-Q\fR specified in a \fI.gnubatch\fR file for
\&\fBgbch-r\fR but not for \fBgbch-rr\fR for example).
.IP "\-q \fIqueuename\fR or +job\-queue \fIqueuename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q queuename or +job-queue queuename"
sets a job queue name as specified on the job or jobs. This may be any
sequence of printable characters.
.IP "\-R or +reschedule\-all" 4
.IX Item "-R or +reschedule-all"
sets the \*(L"not possible\*(R" action of the job or jobs to reschedule all \-
the run is done when it is possible and subsequent runs are
rescheduled by the amount delayed.
.IP "\-r \fIrepeat_spec\fR or +repeat \fIrepeat_spec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r repeat_spec or +repeat repeat_spec"
sets the repeat option of the jobs as specified.
.IP "\-S or +skip\-if\-held" 4
.IX Item "-S or +skip-if-held"
sets the \*(L"not possible\*(R" action of the job or jobs to skip \- the run
is skipped if it could not be done at the specified time.
.IP "\-s or +set" 4
.IX Item "-s or +set"
sets an assignment on the job or jobs to be performed at the start
and/or finish of the job or jobs as selected by a previously-specified
\&\fB\-f\fR option. This option is cumulative, and will add to the list of
assignments specified by previous \fB\-s\fR options. To start from
scratch, precede the assignments with the \fB\-z\fR option.
.IP "\-T \fItime\fR or +time \fItime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T time or +time time"
sets the next run time or time and date of the job or jobs as
specified.
.IP "\-t \fItime\fR or +delete\-time \fItime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t time or +delete-time time"
sets a delete time for the specified job or jobs as a time in hours,
after which it will be automatically deleted if this time has elapsed
since it was queued or last ran. Set to zero to retain the job or jobs
indefinitely.
.IP "\-U or +no\-time" 4
.IX Item "-U or +no-time"
cancels any time setting on the job or jobs set with \fB\-T\fR, \fB\-r\fR or
\&\fB\-o\fR options.
.IP "\-u \fIuser\fR or +set\-owner \fIuser\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u user or +set-owner user"
set the owner of the job or jobs to be \fIuser\fR. The user must have
\&\fIwrite admin file\fR permission to invoke this argument.
.IP "\-V or +no\-verbose" 4
.IX Item "-V or +no-verbose"
cancel the effect of the \fB\-v\fR option, so that a message is not output
giving the job number of each batch job successfully created
.IP "\-v or +verbose" 4
.IX Item "-v or +verbose"
output a message on standard error containing the job number of each
batch job successfully created.
.IP "\-W \fIsig\fR or +which\-signal \fIsig\fR" 4
.IX Item "-W sig or +which-signal sig"
used in conjunction with \fB\-Y\fR and \fB\-2\fR options sets the signal
number, e.g. \fB1\fR, \fB2\fR, \fB15\fR to kill the job or jobs after the
maximum run time has been exceeded.
.IP "\-w or +write\-message" 4
.IX Item "-w or +write-message"
sets the flag whereby completion messages are written to the owner's
terminal if available.
.IP "\-X \fIrange\fR or +exit\-code \fIrange\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X range or +exit-code range"
sets the normal or error exit code ranges for the job or jobs. The
format of the \fIrange\fR argument is \fBN\fR or \fBE\fR followed by a range in
the form \f(CW\*(C`nn:nn\*(C'\fR, thus
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-X N0:9
.Ve
.Sp
and
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-X E10:255
.Ve
.Sp
Note that an exit code which falls inside both ranges will be handled
by the setting of the smaller range, so
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        \-X N0:10
\&        \-X E1:255
.Ve
.Sp
will mean that exit codes 1 to 10 inclusive are treated as \fInormal\fR
as that is the smaller range. Unhandled exit codes are treated as
\&\fIabort\fR. The default is \f(CW\*(C`N0:0\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`E1:255\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-x or +no\-message" 4
.IX Item "-x or +no-message"
resets both flags as set by \fB\-m\fR and \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\-Y \fItime\fR or +run\-time \fItime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Y time or +run-time time"
sets a maximum elapsed run time for the specified job or jobs. The
argument \fItime\fR is in seconds, which may be written as \fImm:ss\fR or
\&\fIhh:mm:ss\fR. The job will be killed with \f(CW\*(C`SIGKILL\*(C'\fR unless a different
signal is specified with the \fB\-W\fR option and a further \*(L"grace time\*(R"
specified with the \fB\-2\fR option.
.IP "\-y or +cancel\-condition" 4
.IX Item "-y or +cancel-condition"
deletes any conditions set up by previous arguments.
.IP "\-z or +cancel\-set" 4
.IX Item "-z or +cancel-set"
deletes any assignments set up by previous arguments.
.IP "\-Z or +cancel\-io" 4
.IX Item "-Z or +cancel-io"
deletes any redirections set up by previous arguments.
.IP "+freeze\-current" 4
.IX Item "+freeze-current"
Save all the current options in a \fI.gnubatch\fR file in the current
directory with keyword \f(CW\*(C`BTR\*(C'\fR for \fBgbch-r\fR or \f(CW\*(C`RBTR\*(C'\fR for \fBgbch-rr\fR.
.IP "+freeze\-home" 4
.IX Item "+freeze-home"
Save all the current options in a \fI.gnubatch\fR file in the user's home
directory with keyword \f(CW\*(C`BTR\*(C'\fR for \fBgbch-r\fR or \f(CW\*(C`RBTR\*(C'\fR for \fBgbch-rr\fR.
.SS "Redirection format"
.IX Subsection "Redirection format"
The format of the argument to the \fB\-I\fR option is similar to that for
the shell with some extensions. The argument should always be enclosed
in quotes to avoid the shell interpreting it rather than \fBgbch-r\fR or
\&\fBgbch-rr\fR.
.PP
Environment variables and \f(CW\*(C`~user\*(C'\fR constructs are expanded at run time
in the strings.
Parameter substitutions, or "meta data" may be included in the
argument strings for redirections, the most important of which is
\fB%t\fR, which inserts the job title. See the Reference manual.
.IP "\fIn\fR<\fIfile\fR" 8
.IX Item "n<file"
For example
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        3<myfile
\&        7</tmp/data
\&        <input_file
.Ve
.Sp
Opens the specified file descriptor for input connected to the
specified file. The file descriptor may be omitted in the common case
of file descriptor 0 (standard input).
.IP "\fIn\fR>\fIfile\fR" 8
.IX Item "n>file"
For example
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        4>outfile
\&        12>/tmp/out
\&        2>errors.%t
\&        >output_file
.Ve
.Sp
Opens the specified file descriptor for output, possibly creating the
file, or truncating it to zero length first if it exists. The file
descriptor may be be omitted in the common case of file descriptor 1
(standard output).
.IP "\fIn\fR>>\fIfile\fR" 8
.IX Item "n>>file"
For example
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        5>>Log
\&        7>>Log.%t
\&        >>output.%t
.Ve
.Sp
As with the shell, this likewise creates the output file if it does
not exists but appends new data to any previous data if it exists,
rather than truncating it.
.IP "\fIn\fR<>\fIfile\fR" 8
.IX Item "n<>file"
For example
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        8<>Data
\&        <>Myfile
.Ve
.Sp
Connect the file descriptor (or file descriptor 0 if not specified)
for input and output, read-write mode.
.IP "\fIn\fR<>>\fIfile\fR" 8
.IX Item "n<>>file"
For example
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        8<>>Data
\&        <>>Myfile
.Ve
.Sp
Select read-write mode, appending to existing data.
.IP "\fIn\fR<|program" 8
.IX Item "n<|program"
For example
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        7<|uname
.Ve
.Sp
Run the specified program and take input from it on the given file
descriptor (defaulting to standard input, file descriptor 0, if not specified).
.IP "\fIn\fR|program" 8
.IX Item "n|program"
For example
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        2|log_errors
\&        |log_output
.Ve
.Sp
Run the specified program and send output to it on the given file
descriptor (defaulting to standard output, file descriptor 1, if not
specified).
.IP "\fIn\fR&\fIn\fR" 8
.IX Item "n&n"
Duplicate the second file descriptor as the first file descriptor
.IP "\fIn\fR&\-" 8
.IX Item "n&-"
Close the given file descriptor.
.SS "Repeat periods"
.IX Subsection "Repeat periods"
The repeat period names for the \fB\-r\fR option are as follows:
.IP "Minutes" 8
.IX Item "Minutes"
Period in minutes
.IP "Hours" 8
.IX Item "Hours"
Period in hours
.IP "Days" 8
.IX Item "Days"
Period in days
.IP "Weeks" 8
.IX Item "Weeks"
Period in weeks
.IP "Monthsb" 8
.IX Item "Monthsb"
Months relative to the beginning
.IP "Monthse" 8
.IX Item "Monthse"
Months relative to the end of the month
.IP "Years" 8
.IX Item "Years"
Period in years
.PP
Each is followed by the number of the relevant periods after a
colon. In the case of the month parameters, then this should be
followed by a \*(L"target day\*(R" after a colon.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        \-r Days:4
\&        \-r Monthsb:1:4
\&        \-r Monthse:1:31
\&        \-r Years:2
.Ve
.PP
For \f(CW\*(C`Monthsb\*(C'\fR the \*(L"target day\*(R" is the day of the month to aim for, in
this case the 4th of the month. If this would be a \*(L"day to avoid\*(R",
then the following day is tried and so on.
.PP
For \f(CW\*(C`Monthse\*(C'\fR the \*(L"target day\*(R" is selected from the day of the month given
in the \fB\-T\fR option. So if the month in the \fB\-T\fR option has 31 days,
then
	\-r Monthse:1:31
.PP
will select the last day of each month and
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-r Monthse:1;30
.Ve
.PP
will select the second last, but if the month in the \fB\-T\fR option has
30 days, the first will be invalid and the second will select the last
day of the month.
.PP
If the selected day cannot be met for any reason, typically because it
does not meet the \*(L"days to avoid\*(R" criteria, then the previous day is
tried until an acceptable day is found. In this way you can select the
\&\*(L"last working day of the month\*(R" or \*(L"next to last working day\*(R" etc.
.SS "Conditions"
.IX Subsection "Conditions"
A condition must be of the form
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [machine:]<varname><condop><constant>.
.Ve
.PP
where \fIvarname\fR is the name of an existing variable for which the
user has read permission.
.PP
\&\fIcondop\fR is one of the following:
.IP "=" 8
equal to
.IP "!=" 8
not equal
.IP "<" 8
less than
.IP "<=" 8
less than or equal
.IP ">" 8
greater than
.IP ">=" 8
greater than or equal
.PP
\&\fIconstant\fR is either a string or a numeric value. If the
string starts with a number then it should be preceded with a colon.
.PP
\&\fBN.B.\fR When invoked from a shell, quotation marks should surround the entire
argument as shown above, otherwise the shell may attach its own
interpretation on the various characters.
.PP
Examples of conditions:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        \-c \*(AqCount>3\*(Aq
\&        \-c \*(AqLock=0\*(Aq
\&        \-c \*(AqRemote:Lock!=0\*(Aq
\&        \-c \*(AqVal=:3rd\*(Aq
.Ve
.SS "Assignments"
.IX Subsection "Assignments"
Each assignment should normally be preceded by a \fB\-f\fR option to
denote when the assignment is applied, apart from exit code and signal
assignments.
.PP
The argument to the \fB\-f\fR option is one or more of the following:
.IP "S" 4
.IX Item "S"
Perform assignment on startup
.IP "N" 4
.IX Item "N"
Perform assignment on normal exit
.IP "E" 4
.IX Item "E"
Perform assignment on error exit
.IP "A" 4
.IX Item "A"
Perform assignment on abort
.IP "C" 4
.IX Item "C"
Perform assignment on cancellation
.IP "R" 4
.IX Item "R"
Reverse assignment for \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`E\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The default if no \fB\-f\fR options are specified is
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-f SNEAR
.Ve
.PP
but the default for this may be changed by editing the message file.
.PP
The format of the argument to the \fB\-s\fR option is in the format
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [machine:]<varname><operator><constant>.
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIvarname\fR is the name of a variable to which the user has read and
write permission.
.PP
\&\fIoperator\fR is one of the following:
.IP "=" 4
Assign value which may be a string or numeric constant. To indicate
that a string starting with a digit is intended to be a string, prefix
it with a colon. Exceptionally, the variable assigned to may have
write permission and not read permission for the user.
.Sp
The effect of the \*(L"reverse\*(R" flag is to assign zero or the null
string. Previous values are not recalled.
.IP "+=" 4
Increment variable by numeric constant. The effect of the \*(L"reverse\*(R"
flag is to decrement the variable by that constant.
.Sp
Arithmetic is as 32\-bit signed integer.
.IP "\-=" 4
Decrement variable by numeric constant. The effect of the \*(L"reverse\*(R"
flag is to increment the variable by that constant.
.Sp
Arithmetic is as 32\-bit signed integer.
.IP "STARHERE=" 4
.IX Item "STARHERE="
Multiply variable by numeric constant. The effect of the \*(L"reverse\*(R"
flag is to divide the variable by that constant.
.Sp
Arithmetic is as 32\-bit signed integer and overflow is ignored.
.IP "/=" 4
Divide variable by numeric constant. The effect of the \*(L"reverse\*(R"
flag is to multiply the variable by that constant.
.Sp
Arithmetic is as 32\-bit signed integer. Note that the remainder from
division is ignored.
.Sp
The handling of negative numbers may be dependent on the hardware and
should probably not be relied upon.
.IP "%=" 4
Take the remainder (modulus) from division by the numeric
constant. There is no \*(L"reverse\*(R" of the operation.
.Sp
Arithmetic is as 32\-bit signed integer. The handling of negative
numbers may be dependent on the hardware and should probably not be
relied upon.
.IP "=exitcode" 4
.IX Item "=exitcode"
Assign the exit code of the job to the given variable. Flags are
ignored and the operation only occurs when the job exits.
.IP "=signal" 4
.IX Item "=signal"
Assign the signal number with which the job terminated to the given
variable, or zero if the job did not exit with a signal. Flags are
ignored and the operation only occurs when the job exits.
.PP
The following are examples of assignments:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        \-s \*(Aqmyvar=7\*(Aq
\&        \-s \*(Aqhost2:hisvar+=1\*(Aq
\&        \-s \*(Aqstatus=exitcode\*(Aq
\&        \-s \*(Aqval=:3rd\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Note the colon in the last assignment indicating that the value is a
string, the colon is not included in the string.
.SS "Mode arguments"
.IX Subsection "Mode arguments"
The argument to the \fB\-M\fR option provides for a wide variety of
operations.
.PP
Each permission is represented by a letter, as follows:
.IP "R" 4
.IX Item "R"
read permission
.IP "W" 4
.IX Item "W"
write permission
.IP "S" 4
.IX Item "S"
reveal permission
.IP "M" 4
.IX Item "M"
read mode
.IP "P" 4
.IX Item "P"
set mode
.IP "U" 4
.IX Item "U"
give away owner
.IP "V" 4
.IX Item "V"
assume owner
.IP "G" 4
.IX Item "G"
give away group
.IP "H" 4
.IX Item "H"
assume group
.IP "D" 4
.IX Item "D"
delete
.IP "K" 4
.IX Item "K"
kill
.PP
Each section of the mode (user, group, others) is represented by the
prefixes \f(CW\*(C`U:\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`G:\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`O:\*(C'\fR and separated by commas.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-M U:RWSMPDK,G:RWSDK,O:RS
.Ve
.PP
would set the permissions for the user, group and others as given. If
the prefixes are omitted, as in
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-M RWSDK
.Ve
.PP
then all of the user, group and other permissions are set to the same
value.
