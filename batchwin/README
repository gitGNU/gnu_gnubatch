This is an alternative interface written in PyQt format.

It was mainly intended as a Windows Client interface but there seemed no
point in it not being a UNIX or GNU/Linux one too so here it is.

At the present time this hasn't been tested on Windows so it probably
wants packaging up with a current version of Python and PyQt for Windows.

I believe that it is mostly debugged and working but there probably
need to be a few interface fixes.

The stuff for packing up structs and such is hypersensitive to changes
in sizes of some of the constants so they desperately want recoding
in XML.

Only downside of that is that it makes a dependency on having libxml
on other platforms than GNU/Linux.

I'll also do the documentation for it real soon now...
